# 🏧 ATM Management System (C++)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **ATM Management System** is a console-based application developed using **C++**.  
It simulates basic ATM operations such as PIN verification, balance inquiry, cash deposit,
cash withdrawal, and PIN change using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.

This project is ideal for beginners to understand real-world applications of C++ classes
and functions.
